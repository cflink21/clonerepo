## Download and  wrangle data and fit linear regression

The following code downloads data from the New York Times API
and create a data frame with the information needed for the plots. Here we fit the line and obtain standard errors using ordinary least squares. 

```{r}
states <-c('pennsylvania', 'georgia', 'arizona', 'nevada')
## Define the percent at which the linear trend starts. Used EDA to determine.
starts <- c(85, 94, 87, 90) 

dat <- map_df(seq_along(states), function(i){
  
  url <- paste0("https://static01.nyt.com/elections-assets/2020/data/api/2020-11-03/race-page/",
                states[i],"/president.json")
  raw <- jsonlite::fromJSON(url)
  
  n <- raw$data$races$tot_exp_vote 

  dat <- raw$data$races$timeseries[[1]]$vote_shares%>%
    mutate(Trumps_lead = (trumpd - bidenj)*100,
           pct_reporting = raw$data$races$timeseries[[1]]$votes / n * 100) %>%
    filter(pct_reporting >= starts[[i]])
  
  fit <- lm(Trumps_lead ~ pct_reporting, data = dat)
  
  x <- c(dat$pct_reporting, seq(max(dat$pct_reporting), 100, len = 25))
                
  ## We computer standard errors assuming independence
  ## These data are clearly not independent so the error bars underestimate
  ## Furthermore we think the main source of variability comes from m
  fit <- predict(fit, newdata = data.frame(pct_reporting = x), se.fit = TRUE)
  
  fit_tab <- data.frame(pct_reporting = x, 
                        reg_line = fit$fit, 
                        upper = fit$fit + 1.96 * fit$se,
                        lower = fit$fit - 1.96 * fit$se)
  
  
  dat <- left_join(fit_tab, dat, by = "pct_reporting") %>%
    mutate(state = str_to_title(states[i]), n= n)
  
  dat
})
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
## save in case API goes away
## Note an rdas directory will be created
if(!file.exists("rdas")) dir.create("rdas") 
saveRDS(dat, paste0("rdas/election-night-updates-",format(lubridate::now(), "%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S"),".rds"))
```

## Make the plot

```{r election-count-update, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
dat %>% 
  mutate(state = paste0(state, " (expected total vote = ", prettyNum(n, big.mark = ","), ")")) %>%
  mutate(state = reorder(state, -n, first)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pct_reporting, y = Trumps_lead)) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'loess', formula = "y~x", se=FALSE, lty = 2) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), alpha = 0.25) +
  geom_line(aes(y = reg_line)) +
  ggtitle("Vote difference through the count") + 
  xlab("Percent reporting") + ylab("Trump's percentage lead") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lty = 2) +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~state, scales = "free") 
```

## Latest reported difference and final estimate

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
final_estimate <- dat %>% 
  arrange(desc(pct_reporting)) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(state, reg_line) %>%
  mutate(reg_line = format(round(-reg_line, 1), nsmall=1)) %>%
  setNames(c("State", "Final Estiamte"))
last_update <- dat %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Trumps_lead)) %>%
  arrange(desc(pct_reporting)) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(Biden_lead = format(-Trumps_lead, nsmall = 1)) %>%
  select(state, Biden_lead) %>%
  setNames(c("State", "Current Biden lead"))
left_join(last_update, final_estimate, by = "State") %>% knitr::kable(align = c("l","r","r"))
```


## The Math

Why is it a linear trend? The main drive for this is the fact that
by the end of election night most rural in person votes were counted. These votes
went for Trump. Let's call the difference

 
*b* = election day votes for Trump - election day votes for Biden


However, in the case of Pennsylvania and Georgia, mail-in votes and some votes from large metropolitan areas, Philadelphia and Atlanta for example,
were not counted by the end of election night. These votes went for Biden by a wide margin. Let's call this difference 


*m* = mail in and late metro area votes for Trump - mail in and late metro area votes for Biden


At the end of the count, the total difference will be: *b + m*

However, during the days after the election we were only seeing a percent, call it *x*, of the mail in and late metro area votes. So
the observed difference had expected value

*f(x)  = b + mx*


As the night progressed, *x* grew and because *m* is negative, the observed difference *f(x)* decreased linearly, with slope *m*, as the percent *x* grew.
Once *x=1* we will see the final differences *f(1) = b+m*.


Note that in the case of Arizona, where mail-in vote has always been popular, *m* was not negative, in fact it was slightly positive.


## Technical notes

* In each state, the data points are not independent because they are updated percentages, not just from new votes. As a result
the standard errors used to construct the confidence intervals are underestimated.

* The main source of variation seems to be the expected total vote, which changed throughout the night. Note that when this estimated total changes, 
all the x-values change and the entire plots moves to the left or to the right. Only when we are done counting will we know what the total vote was.

* *mx* actually follows a binomial distribution and *f(x) - b* is actually its expected value. But because the number of votes being considered was very large, the standard error of this random variable was negligible. We assume the observed point is $b+mx$.

* We show the percentages rather than the totals because this is what is included in the API. So we are not really seeing *f(x)* but *f(x)* divided by the total votes until that moment. Because we are almost done counting, this total is not changing much, and the linear approximation holds.
